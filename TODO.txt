Catherine is working on:
Probably start at near-misses?

Elizabeth is working on:
* Verbs

Alan is working on:

Rob is working on:
* Add additional stuff based on ConceptNet
when you have "A person can <verb> <noun>"
then you add "A person can <verb>"
and "A <noun> can be <verb>ed"


Good quick projects:
* Re-add inflections when generating the understand statements.  Thus "Dwell" turns into "Dwelling".
* Generate list of concepts not to use a similarity - we can do that from the game matrix.  Put those in the .over file.
* For goodnessake, add a threshold in the thing that generates the "understand" statements!
* Ad-hoc cats for things with multiple descriptors.  Catherine wrote the capability into the reasoning code, we need to figure it out from the game matrix.

Someone should work on:
* WordNet or not to wordnet? Catherine wrote code to order things via WN similarity. Does it help?  Does it hurt?  Should it just be blended in normally? Which similarity is best.
* Deal with Near-misses.  Can we help suggest new commands on mistakes:
Not all cases are "near misses" that we can easily identify. In some
cases, we want the result to still be a "mistake", but the mistake
message should suggest some reasonable things in the game's vocabulary
that the person could do. What we should do, then, is exhaustively list the ConceptNet phrases
we can understand that are not in the game's vocabulary and give them
"mistake" responses that suggest things that do work in game.
