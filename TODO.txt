Catherine is working on:
* Probably start at near-misses?
* Alt user test

Elizabeth is working on: 6.046
Alan is working on: Splash
Rob is working on: Splash
Kevin is working on: Brainz


Good quick projects:
* Re-add inflections when generating the understand statements.  Thus "Dwell" turns into "Dwelling".
* For goodnessake, add a threshold in the thing that generates the "understand" statements!
* Ad-hoc cats for things with multiple descriptors.  Catherine wrote the capability into the reasoning code, we need to figure it out from the game matrix.
* Make Verb sims into inform code
* Find everything printing random stuff and make it stop

Someone should work on:
* WordNet or not to wordnet? Catherine wrote code to order things via WN similarity. Does it help?  Does it hurt?  Should it just be blended in normally? Which similarity is best.
* Try with another game - such as the bookstore env.
* Normalization.  Post normalize?  Normalize all? Huh?
* Hook to inform!

Alt User test:
Add some objects like, say, a chandelier.

Infer its features in terms of Inform:
* What properties should it have? (Can you stand on it? Can you move
it? Can you put things in it? Can you use it to see in the dark? These
appear as HasProperty statements.)
* Where does it fit in the class hierarchy? (Find the best IsA
statement that relates to a class.)
* Where might it be located when the game starts? (AtLocation)
